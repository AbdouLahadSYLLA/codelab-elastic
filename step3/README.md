# Step 3 - Indexing our logs with Filebeat

We will now enable Filebeat and index and visualize the logs generated by NGINX. These logs will be indexed wihout any modifications

* Download Filebeat

```shell
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-6.2.3-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf filebeat-6.2.3-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
```

* Create the filebeat.yml configuration file

* In order to start you should executed the following commands :

```shell
docker-compose up
sudo chown root config/filebeat/filebeat.yml
sudo bin/filebeat -e -c config/filebeat/filebeat.yml
```

* Add the corresponding index into Kibana and have a look to the data

  * Explain we have no data is the generated Kibana Dashboard (modules disabled for the moment)
  * Show the data in the Discover panel

* Create a time serie in order to visualize the number of request by seconds
